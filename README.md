# fs-lab-ml

Early-stage machine learning repository focused on data ingestion and incremental analysis.

The initial goal of this project is to establish a clean and reproducible foundation for fetching, storing, and inspecting data.  
More complex operations (validation, feature engineering, modeling) will be introduced step by step.

## Scope

- Data ingestion only (initial phase)
- No models, no training pipelines
- Experimental, but structured

## Status

🚧 Work in progress
